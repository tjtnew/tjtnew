- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tjtnew but actually [@TimTaylor](https://github.com/TimTaylor) (keep reading for an explanation) 
- ðŸ‘€ GitHub very kindly let me take over the [@TimTaylor](https://github.com/TimTaylor) account due to name squatting by the previous occupant.
- ðŸŒ± GitHub do a great job of making that process as smoothe as possible but just in case Iâ€™m maintaining this old account so I can point to [@TimTaylor](https://github.com/TimTaylor).
- âŒ› I'll probably delete this account in early 2022.
- âœ¨ [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is awesome âœ¨
